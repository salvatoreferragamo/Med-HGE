# A Plug-and-Play Knowledge-Enhanced Module for Medical Reports Generation

This is the repo for **Med-HGE**.  

  
We release the initial version of our model's code for immediate access and reproduction. We will subsequently organize and update our code further to facilitate the researchers reading and making incremental experiments.
